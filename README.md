# Connect4_Game-Java-Application-Programming-

This project presents a **Connect-4 Game** developed using Java's **Swing** and **AWT** libraries. It facilitates two-player gameplay, where players alternate turns dropping pieces into a grid, with automated win condition checks after each move. Future enhancements will incorporate multiplayer functionality over a local network. This project was developed in collaboration with Ayan Satani (ayanstani123@gmail.com).

## Key Features:  
- **Interactive Grid-Based Layout**: Designed using Javaâ€™s GridLayout to reflect the grid-based movement of pucks in the game.  
- **Fully Functional UI**: All interface elements are responsive and visually complete, providing a solid foundation for integrating game logic.  
- **MVC Architecture**: Implemented the Model-View-Controller (MVC) design pattern to ensure modularity and simplify maintenance and future enhancements.  
- **Local Connectivity with TCP/IP**: Integrated TCP for local network connectivity (currently under development) to enable multiplayer functionality.  
- **Efficient Data Structure**: Utilized a 2D array to represent the game board, allowing efficient management of game state.  
- **Optimized Algorithms**: Applied an iterative search algorithm to identify the lowest available row in a selected column and used pattern matching to detect winning conditions.
